# Crewmeister coding challenge solution

### Description

To solve the coding challenge and pass all the acceptance criterias, my plan was to develop a application to emulate what a real world API and Web FrontEnd communicating would look like. So I decided to develop the following three project parts:

  - js_version -> `API using Express`
  - ruby_version -> `API using Sinatra`
  - bonus -> `Web FrontEnd using React`

Each one of the projects have its own detailed description.

#### `js_version` and `ruby_version`

By default, servers `run on port 3333`

#### `bonus`

Provide a Web FrontEnd which consume one of the developed API. So, in order to run the FronEnd and actually see the data, it is necessary that either the `js_edition` or the `ruby_edition` servers are running.

By default, servers `run on port 3000`
