# Crewmeister coding challenge solution

### Description

 My plan to solve the coding challenge and pass all the acceptance criterias was to develop an application to emulate what a real-world API and Web FrontEnd communication would look like. So I decided to develop the following three projects:

  - js_version -> `API using Express`
  - ruby_version -> `API using Sinatra`
  - bonus -> `Web FrontEnd using React`

Each one of the projects has its detailed description provided in README files.

#### `js_version` and `ruby_version`

By default, servers will run on port `3333`  and can be accessible by going to **http://localhost:3333**

#### `bonus`

Provide a Web FrontEnd that consumes one of the developed APIs. So, to run the FronEnd and see the data, either the 'js_edition' or the 'ruby_edition' server must be running.

By default, the FrontEnd will run on port `3000` and can be accessible by going to **http://localhost:3000**
